#Gigmapper

A week-long assignment in week 9 of the 16-week programming course at CodeClan. The aim was to consolidate and build upon what we had learned in weeks 6-8 including:

- Javascript ( Node / Browser )
- Async programming
- Full-stack Javascript apps ( using Express with a Mongo database )
- Collaborative source control

Gigmapper allows users to search for gigs in a particular area using Google Maps’ and Ticketmaster’s APIs. It was created using vanilla JavaScript (i.e. no front-end framework), Express and Mongo. As our first team project, it was an opportunity to practice collaborative source control; using master, develop and feature branches, and successfully managing merge conflicts.
